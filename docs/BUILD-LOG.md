# LegalEdge Phase 1.1 — build log

The durable memory of this build. One dated section per stage: what was built,
what was decided, where we deviated from the plan, what is knowingly missing, and
what the next stage needs. This file plus
`LegalEdge-Phase1.1-Knowledge-Base-and-RAG.docx` should be enough for a session
with no other context to continue the work.

Ten stages, built one at a time, each on its own branch, each ending green.

## 2026-09-10 · Stage 0 — Scaffold and environment

Branch `stage-0-scaffold`. The repository started empty; nothing was inherited or
migrated. (A neighbouring folder, `~/Desktop/LegalEdge-AI-Project-main`, holds an
unrelated June 2025 Flask/Ollama prototype. It shares no architecture with this
plan and was deliberately left untouched.)

### Built

- **Repository layout** per spec §12, minus everything the scope fences exclude
  (see ADR 0002). `tests/unit/test_repo_layout.py` asserts the required
  directories exist *and* that the out-of-scope ones do not, so a later session
  cannot quietly start an `apps/web/`.
- **Dependencies.** `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth, every direct
  dependency pinned to an exact version (no wildcards — a test enforces this).
  Four groups: default (API + CLI), `corpus`, `dev`, `eval`. `requirements/*.txt`
  is generated from it by `scripts/sync_requirements.py`, and
  `tests/unit/test_requirements_sync.py` fails if the two drift.
- **Dockerfile**, multi-stage: a builder that compiles into `/opt/venv`, and a
  runtime with no compilers, running as non-root `legaledge` (uid 1001). System
  packages: `tesseract-ocr`, `tesseract-ocr-hin`, `ghostscript`, `qpdf`,
  `poppler-utils`, `libpq5`. `HEALTHCHECK` hits `/v1/health`.
- **Compose.** `compose.yml` = `postgres` (pgvector/pgvector:pg16, volume,
  healthcheck) + `api`, with `redis` behind a `cache` profile.
  `compose.prod.yml` adds Caddy and unpublishes the API and database ports.
  `compose.observability.yml` is the optional Langfuse overlay. Model weights live
  in a named volume (`model-cache` → `/models`, `HF_HOME`) so containers do not
  re-download on restart.
- **Settings** (`app/core/config.py`): one pydantic-settings object, every value
  from the environment, required values with no default so startup fails loudly
  and legibly. `CREDENTIAL_ENC_KEY` is validated as 32 base64 bytes at load time,
  not at first use. `FETCH_USER_AGENT` must carry a contact address.
  `MAX_CHUNK_TOKENS` is validated against the embedding model's 512-token ceiling.
- **structlog**: JSON in deployment, console locally, with a redaction processor
  that blanks secret-shaped keys and *drops* keys that can carry user text or a
  full prompt (`question`, `prompt`, `messages`, `answer`, `turns`).
- **Exception hierarchy** (`app/core/errors.py`) mapped to HTTP in exactly one
  place (`app/core/error_handlers.py`), with a uniform
  `{"error": {code, message, details?, request_id}}` envelope.
  `missing_provider_key` is a distinct 402 so a frontend can route to Settings.
- **`GET /v1/health`**: app version, database connectivity and latency, whether
  the schema exists yet, and corpus counts. 200 when healthy, 503 + `degraded`
  when the database is unreachable. `GET /metrics` via
  prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator.
- **`legaledge-kb` CLI** with `version` and `check-config`. Pipeline verbs are
  *not* registered until the stage that implements them, and a test asserts they
  are absent — `--help` never advertises a command that does nothing.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): requirements-sync check, `ruff check`,
  `ruff format --check`, `mypy`, `pytest` against a pgvector service container,
  plus a separate job that builds the image.
- **Docs**: this log, ADR 0001 (retrieval models), ADR 0002 (backend-only scope),
  README.

### Decisions

1. **ADR 0001 — retrieval models.** `NyayaLabs98/nyaya-embed-v1` (768 dims) for
   dense retrieval, not BGE-M3 (1024); `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` for reranking,
   swappable by config; `law-ai/InLegalBERT` excluded from the retrieval path;
   every model loaded at a pinned revision SHA. The e5 `passage:`/`query:`
   prefixes and the 512-token ceiling are encoded as constants in
   `app/core/config.py` and asserted by tests.
2. **ADR 0002 — backend only.** No frontend, no upload, no generation, no chat
   persistence, no queue, no object storage, no Kubernetes.
3. **Dependency groups, not one flat set.** `docling` + `ocrmypdf` + `datasets`
   (~1.5 GB) are `corpus` extras, installed into the image only when
   `INSTALL_CORPUS=true`. The request path never imports them.
4. **`sqlalchemy[asyncio]`, not bare `sqlalchemy`.** Found by a failing test: the
   async engine needs `greenlet`, which only arrives via that extra. Without it
   the API imports fine and fails on the first database call.
5. **Local Postgres port.** The developer machine already had something on 5432,
   so local runs use `POSTGRES_PORT=5433`. `.env.example` keeps 5432; CI uses 5432.

### Deviations from the plan

| Plan says | We did | Why |
|---|---|---|
| BGE-M3, `vector(1024)` | nyaya-embed-v1, `vector(768)` | ADR 0001, per instruction |
| Compose services `web, api, postgres, caddy` | `postgres, api` (+ optional `redis`, `langfuse`); Caddy in the prod overlay | No frontend in this repository (ADR 0002) |
| `uv` for dependency management | pip + generated `requirements/*.txt` | `uv` is not installed on this machine; pyproject stays the source of truth |
| PEP 735 `[dependency-groups]` | `[project.optional-dependencies]` | Local pip is 24.2; PEP 735 needs pip ≥ 25.1 |
| `langfuse==2.5*.*` | `langfuse==2.59.7` | Highest release inside the requested series |
| `litellm==1.5*.*` | `litellm==1.59.12` | Same |

### Bugs found and fixed inside this stage

Recorded because each was invisible to source inspection and only surfaced when
something real ran:

1. **`greenlet` missing.** SQLAlchemy's async engine needs it; it is not a
   dependency of bare `sqlalchemy`. Surfaced only when a test opened a real
   connection. Fixed by pinning `sqlalchemy[asyncio]==2.0.36`.
2. **Loggers created at import time escaped the redaction processor.**
   `get_logger()` used `structlog.get_logger().bind(...)`, and `.bind()`
   materialises the proxy against whatever configuration is installed *at that
   moment* — which, for a module-level logger, is structlog's console default.
   Every module logger would have logged unredacted secrets for the life of the
   process. The container's non-JSON log lines were the only visible symptom.
   Fixed by passing the name as an initial value (`logger_name`, renamed to
   `logger` by a processor, because `logger` is a reserved kwarg) so the proxy
   resolves lazily. Regression test:
   `test_logger_created_before_configuration_still_redacts`.
3. **`/v1/health` returned 500 when the database was unreachable.** Not every
   driver failure is a `SQLAlchemyError` — asyncpg raises
   `InvalidAuthorizationSpecificationError` straight through on connect. A health
   probe must report `degraded`, never crash. Fixed with a deliberately broad
   catch that reports the exception *class* in the response, so a bug in our own
   SQL still shows up by name. Test:
   `test_driver_level_failure_is_degraded_not_a_500`.

### Known gaps at the end of Stage 0

- **No Alembic environment yet** (`apps/api/alembic/` is an empty tree). Stage 1
  owns `alembic.ini`, `env.py` and the first migration. `schema_ready` on
  `/health` is therefore `false`, and the corpus counts are structurally zero.
- **`EMBED_MODEL_REVISION` and `RERANK_MODEL_REVISION` ship empty.** The real SHAs
  cannot be resolved without downloading the model repositories, which Stage 4
  does. An empty revision must fail loudly at model-load time rather than
  silently resolving to `main`. No placeholder SHA was invented.
- **No lockfile.** Direct dependencies are pinned exactly; transitive ones are
  not. If reproducibility becomes a requirement, `uv lock` or `pip-compile` is the
  answer — ask before adding either.
- **`content/corpus/manifest.yaml` does not exist** (Stage 2). Note that PyYAML is
  *not* in the approved dependency list but the manifest is specified as YAML —
  flagged for decision.
- **Rate limiting is not implemented** (Stage 9 per the plan). No rate-limiting
  library was added.

### What Stage 1 needs

- An Alembic environment reading `Settings.database_url_sync` (psycopg), with
  `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` in the first migration.
- Nine tables per spec §06 plus `users` and `api_credentials`.
- `embedding vector(768)` — see `EMBEDDING_DIM` in `app/core/config.py`. Getting
  this wrong means re-embedding the whole corpus later.
- HNSW on `kb_chunks.embedding` (cosine, `m=16`, `ef_construction=64`), GIN on
  `kb_chunks.tsv`, btree on `(statute_id, section_no_sort)`.
- `section_no_sort` must order legal citations correctly: 9 before 10, and 2A, 14B
  and 21-A in their right places. Tests for that ordering specifically.
- Once the models exist, move `app/services/corpus_stats.py` off its lightweight
  `sqlalchemy.table()` constructs and onto the ORM models.
